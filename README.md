## Quick start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Download a lightweight version of TNRD denoising from
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9L0NyTobx_3NHdJLUtPQWJmc2c/view?usp=sharing.
3. Unzip the file tnrd_denoising.zip (containing 7 files in total) to the folder 
   located in `YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/RED/tnrd_denoising`.
4. Download test images from
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzCe024Ewz8aZ3pNQXNqYXJseTQ?usp=sharing
   and copy to the folder located in `YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/RED/test_images`.
5. Open Matlab and change the current folder to `YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/RED` (use "cd" function).
6. In Matlab's command window run
   ```
   >> main
   ```
